Python is one of the most common programming languages these days because it is clear and simple (it's like writing in a plain English). 

```python
if degree > 70:
  print("pass")
```

## So, why do you want to learn programming and why here?
First of all, we are no going to focus on the code itself. Instead, we are going to focus on the thinking and how to make decisions (since any AI tool can write the code, we need to decide what we want and why). 

<b>AI is not going to solve your problems unless you have a way to figure it out.</b>

## Final Note
I will not go deep in most of the topics since the goal to make you love programming. So, you need to do a lot of practice by yourself (try the code, tweak it, ...).
