# DNA and Protein Sequences.
There are two files we want; first one is Strand of DNA while the other is the corresponding protein sequence.

**Files source**: Download a DNA strand as a text file from a public web-based repository of DNA sequences from [**NCBI**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).The Nucleotide sample is ( NM_207618.2 ), which can be found [**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_207618.2).

* Steps
  - Choose a Nucleotide database type instead of “all databases”.
  - In the search field, write “NM_207618.2” and hit search.
  - At the top of the page found and click on the word “FASTA”
  - Using your mouse and cursor to copy the Strand of DNA and save it in a .txt file.
  - Go back the data page and click on “CDS” to download the corresponding protein sequence.
